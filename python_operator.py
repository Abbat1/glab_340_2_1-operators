#Below is how we use basic operators and we print them in the terminal.

# print('Addition of two numbers:',a+b)  
# print('Subtraction of two numbers:',a-b)  
# print('Multiplication of two numbers:',a*b)  
# print('Division of two numbers:',a/b)  
# print('Reminder of two numbers:',a%b)  
# print('Exponent of two numbers:',a**b)  
# print('Floor division of two numbers:',a//b)  
# MultipleOperators = 1 + 2 * 3 / 4.0
# print("Result of MultipleOperators is: ",MultipleOperators)


# Below is how we use Assignment operators and we print them in the terminal.


# a = 32         # Initialize the value of a  
# b = 6          # Initialize the value of b  
# print('a=b:', a==b)  #
# print('a+=b:', a+b)  # shorthand of a = a + b
# print('a-=b:', a-b)  # shorthand of a = a - b
# print('a*=b:', a*b)  # shorthand of a = a * b
# print('a%=b:', a%b)  # shorthand of a = a % b
# print('a**=b:', a**b)  # shorthand of a = a ** b
# print('a//=b:', a//b)  # shorthand of a = a/ b  
   
# j = 10 # j gets the value 10.
# print("j is : " , j)
# j = 5 # j gets the value 5. The previous value is overwritten.
# k = j # k gets the value 5.
# print("j is : " , j)
# print("k is : " , k)


# k = j = 10; # (k = (j = 10))
# print("j is : " , j)
# print("k is : " , k)


# Below is an example code of Comparison operators thatwe can use in python.

# a = 32      # Initialize the value of a  
# b = 6       # Initialize the value of b  
# print('Two numbers are equal or not:',a==b)  
# print('Two numbers are not equal or not:',a!=b)  
# print('a is less than or equal to b:',a<=b)  
# print('a is greater than or equal to b:',a>=b)  
# print('a is greater b:',a>b)  
# print('a is less than b:',a<b) 

# Below is an example code of Logical operators that we can use in python.

# a=5              #initiliaze the value of a      
# print('Is this statement true?:',a>3 and a<5)
# print('Is this statement true?:',a>3 or a<5)
# print('Is this statement true?:',(not(a>3 and a<5)))


# #Below is an example code of Identity operators that we can use in python.


# a=["rose", "lotus"]
# b=["rose", "lotus"]
# c=a
# print(a is c)
# print(a is not c)
# print(a is b)
# print(a is not b)
# print(a == b)
# print(a != b)



#Below is an example code of Membership operators that we can use in python.

x = ["rose", "lotus"]
print('Is value Present?' "rose" in x) 
print('Is value not Present?' "riya" not in x)

x ='hello world'
y ={1:'a',2:'b'}

#check if 'h' is present in the string
print('h' in x)
#check in 'hello' is not present in the string
print('hello' not in x)  # prints True
# check if '1' key is present in y
print(1 in y)  # prints True
# check if 'a' key is present in y
print('a' in y)  # prints False
